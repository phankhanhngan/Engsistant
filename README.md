## Description
Engsistant is a system designed to aid English language teachers and tutors in optimizing their lesson preparation time. The system is capable of automatically generating lesson plans and recommending content for these lessons. Each lesson plan includes sections dedicated to vocabulary and grammar, which are fundamental components of learning English. The system offers functionalities tailored to two main user roles: teachers and students.

**Features for Teachers:**
- Class Integration: Seamlessly import classes from Google Classroom.
- Lesson Creation: Effortlessly build comprehensive English lessons.
- Content Sharing: Share created lessons directly to Google Classroom.
- Slide Preparation: Import lessons into Canva to create visually appealing slides.


**Features for Students:**
- Vocabulary and Grammar Learning: Enhance learning through automatically generated lessons.
- Interactive Learning Tools: Utilize flashcards to reinforce vocabulary and grammar knowledge.
- Review Marking: Mark vocabulary or grammar items for later review, enabling focused revision.
